The maid will I frame, and make fit for his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?</line>

The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answer&#8217;d, he would never bring them to light. Would he were return&#8217;d! Marry, this Claudio is condemn&#8217;d for untrussing. Farewell, good friar, I prithee pray for me. The Duke (I say to thee again) would eat mutton on Fridays.

Novelty is only in request, and, as it is, as dangerous to be ag&#8217;d in any kind of course, as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure, but security enough to make fellowships accurs&#8217;d. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world.

Look, th&#8217; unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be; all difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine&#8217;s head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amaz&#8217;d, but this shall absolutely resolve you.
