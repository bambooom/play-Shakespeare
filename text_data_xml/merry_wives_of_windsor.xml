The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais&#8217;d for my jealousy! Eleven o&#8217; clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng&#8217;d on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late.

Well, and I be serv&#8217;d such another trick, I&#8217;ll have my brains ta&#8217;en out and butter&#8217;d, and give them to a dog for a new-year&#8217;s gift. The rogues slighted me into the river with as little remorse as they would have drown&#8217;d a blind bitch&#8217;s puppies, fifteen i&#8217; th&#8217; litter; and you may know by my size that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; and the bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had been drown&#8217;d, but that the shore was shelvy and shallow&#8212;a death that I abhor; for the water swells a man; and what a thing should I have been when I had been swell&#8217;d! I should have been a mountain of mummy.</line>

Being thus cramm&#8217;d in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s knaves, his hinds, were call&#8217;d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who ask&#8217;d them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quak&#8217;d for fear, lest the lunatic knave would have search&#8217;d it; but fate (ordaining he should be a cuckold) held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffer&#8217;d the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compass&#8217;d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then to be stopp&#8217;d in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that&#8212;a man of my kidney. Think of that&#8212;that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath (when I was more than half stew&#8217;d in grease, like a Dutch dish) to be thrown into the Thames, and cool&#8217;d, glowing-hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that&#8212;hissing-hot&#8212;think of that, Master Brook.</line>
