<line globalnumber="686" number="3" form="prose">With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they cry &#8220;hem!&#8221; and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned&#8212;to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp&#8217;d even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other English in his life than &#8220;Eight shillings and sixpence,&#8221; and &#8220;You are welcome,&#8221; with this shrill addition, &#8220;Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,&#8221; or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling &#8220;Francis,&#8221; that his tale to me may be nothing but &#8220;Anon.&#8221; Step aside, and I&#8217;ll show thee a president.</line>

Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied; for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother&#8217;s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be ask&#8217;d. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be ask&#8217;d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</line>

If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish.

<line globalnumber="1242" number="76" form="verse">Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</line>

I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen&#8217;s sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask&#8217;d twice on the banes, such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I press&#8217;d me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins&#8217; heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies&#8212;slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton&#8217;s dogs lick&#8217;d his sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fall&#8217;n, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feaz&#8217;d ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty totter&#8217;d prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and press&#8217;d the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I&#8217;ll not march through Coventry with them, that&#8217;s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There&#8217;s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tack&#8217;d together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald&#8217;s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stol&#8217;n from my host at Saint Albons, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.
