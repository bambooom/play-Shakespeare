<title>Introduction</title>
<line><titleref>The Rape of Lucrece</titleref> is the second of Shakespeare&#8217;s narrative poems, a follow-up to Venus and Adonis. Like the latter, Shakespeare had it published with care, but it was not as popular as the previous work: people appear to have bought but not read it. As a contemporary commentator noted, it is a much more serious and philosophical work, and though it contains a notably sensual description of the half-naked Lucrece, it does not have the unrestrained bawdry of Venus and Adonis, nor its humor.</line>

<line>The plot is taken from Roman history, events that legend has it led to the establishment of the Republic in place of the monarchy. A Roman nobleman, Collatine, makes the mistake of boasting of his wife&#8217;s chastity; the boast arouses the Prince of Rome, Tarquin, who gallops to Collatine&#8217;s house, is welcomed by Lucrece, and in the middle of the night rapes her. In the morning she determines to kill herself for shame, waits for Collatine to return home to tell him what has occurs, and stabs herself. In her name, the Romans nobles exile Tarquin.</line>

<line>Shakespeare embroiders the story with long descriptive and meditative passages, written in a rhyme scheme that denoted seriousness to the Elizabethans. Themes from the poem recur continuously in his plays, including in <titleref>Titus Andronicus</titleref>, <titleref>Macbeth</titleref>, <titleref>Cymbeline</titleref>, and, especially (when it comes to Lucrece&#8217;s meditations on the nature of chastity), <titleref>Measure for Measure</titleref>.</line>

<title>Synopsis</title>
<line><lineref>Lines Lines 1-49:</lineref> Sextus Tarquinius, son of the King of Rome, gallops away from the army&#8217;s camp, inflamed with lust for Collatine&#8217;s wife Lucrece. Last night, Collatine foolishly praised her chastity to the skies, revelling in his luck at having married a faithful wife. Tarquin was so aroused that he has abandoned all his duties to have her.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 50-119:</lineref> Arriving at Collatium, he is welcomed by Lucrece, as beautiful as she is virtuous, who perceives no threat in him. The only sign of his thoughts is that he looks at her a bit too much; but she has been so cloistered that she does not notice. He tells Lucrece that her husband is gaining glory in the war, and makes excuses for why he has come to visit.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 120-161:</lineref> After dining and talking with Lucrece, Tarquin is shown to his bed. Unable to sleep, he considers the dangers of going through with his plan, but the desire to have his will is stronger than scruple or risk, or for that matter honor, or his own reputation and self-worth.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 162-238:</lineref> At the darkest hour of the night, Tarquin gets up, somewhat afraid of what he is planning but too intent on it to stop. He debates with himself. Going through with the deed will make him a shameful man, a disgrace to his family, unfit to be a soldier because incapable of controlling himself. Even if he dies, people will remember him only for his crime; his reputation will be forever lost. How can he give all this up simply for a moment&#8217;s pleasure? What excuse can he find for mistreating his friend and kinsman Collatine? </line>

<line><lineref>Lines 239-301:</lineref> But the shame is only if people know. He decides to beg Lucrece to give in; his self-control is strong enough to deal with rejection, if she rejects him. The memory of her beauty makes him toss off other considerations. He is young and martial, and so he stops looking for excuses and admits what he intends. He creeps towards Lucrece&#8217;s room, imagining her, also imagining Collatine staring reprovingly at him; but his lust only grows.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 301-336:</lineref> He begins to break his way through the locked doors leading to Lucrece&#8217;s bedchamber. The warning signs he encounters strike him only as delays and risks that will add more spice to the event.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 337-364:</lineref> Reaching Lucrece&#8217;s bedroom door, he prays that Lucrece will give in. But considering that the gods do not approve of rape and will therefore not help him, he stops. Leaving off doubts, he opens the door.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 365-441:</lineref> After a moment looking, he approaches Lucrece&#8217;s bed and opens its curtain; for a moment he is blinded, by shame or by her beauty. But he soon sees again, and begins to note every detail of her naked form he can see. The more he looks, the more he wants. For a moment, just looking is enough, but soon desire comes flooding back, and he begins to stroke her breasts.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 442-539:</lineref> The touch awakens her, confused and then frightened. He can feel her heart beating, and this only drives him on. He asks her to give in, but she refuses. He informs her that he has come to take her, blames her beauty, and announces that she has no choice but to submit, or he will take her by force. If she makes him use violence, he will kill her, then kill a slave and place him in her bed, leaving her to be remembered as a shameful whore by all. If she does not struggle, then they can simply keep matters secret.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 540-651:</lineref> She begins to plead, but this only whets his appetite. She begs, stumbling over her word. He cannot truly be Tarquin the prince of Rome, who should have better self-control; his actions here presage that he will be a tyrannous king who will be only feared, not loved; his people will act like him and he will be unable to condemn them; his natural kingliness should prevent him from continuing. He tells her to be silent.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 652-688:</lineref> She argues that he will turn his world upside down, but he will not let her continue: he gives her one last chance to yield, repeating his threat about leaving her in the arms of a slave. Then he stamps out his torch and rapes her, wrapping her head in her nightclothes so that she won&#8217;t be heard.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 689-742:</lineref> Tarquin finds thathe did not enjoy himself as much as he had hoped. He recognizes that he has disgraced himself forever, and that his soul will never recover. Pondering this he steals from Lucrece&#8217;s room, leaving her to tear at herself and bewail what has occurred. By the standards of the time, she is utterly disgraced.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 743-840:</lineref> As Tarquin waits for day, Lucrece hopes it will not arrive. She rails against sleep and against night, which assisted Tarquin, and feeling utterly alone, she wishes she at least had someone to suffer with her. She is terrified of the day, when her shame will be obvious, when the story of what just happened will become common knowledge and used by everyone as an example. She grows distressed at how, by being raped, she has dishonored her husband.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 841-924:</lineref> She notes the paradox of her situation: she has dishonored Collatine, but she would also have dishonored him by not welcoming Tarquin into her house. Tarquin seemed tired and talked of virtue, but there is no such thing as perfection. Every good or pleasant thing has its evil counterpart, allowing the evil opportunities to exercise their wickedness against the innocent. She rants against opportunity, that never helps the worthy or the weak, only the wicked, and is therefore guilty of every crime ever committed.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 925-1015:</lineref> She deplores the inability of time to run backwards. She entreats time to leave Tarquin&#8217;s sleep nightmare-ridden, his life miserable and long enough that he sees his world crumble around him and remains incapable of forgetting what he&#8217;s done. She calls on time to drive Tarquin to suicide: he is unworthy of being killed by anyone but himself; being a king&#8217;s son makes him even worse a criminal.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1016-1078:</lineref> But this is all useless. The only way to erase her shame is suicide. She muses at the irony that she was afraid of Tarquin&#8217;s sword and is now looking for a knife. Then she was a loyal wife; now she cannot think of herself as such. Her chastity was the great meaning of her life, and now it is gone. Committing suicide will also ensure that there is no risk of Collatine having a secret bastard among his children. But before she kills herself, she will tell Collatine what happened: she will not let Tarquin suggest she was willing.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1079-1148:</lineref> The sun is rising, to Lucrece&#8217;s dismay; the joyful sound of birds only makes her grief worse, and she accuses them of mocking her. She wishes that the nightingale, a bird that was once Philomel, who was also raped, would come and nest in her hair and sing.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1149-1211:</lineref> Still not entirely determined to kill herself, Lucrece considers whether her body or her soul is more important, but decides that since the body houses the soul, it would be unfair to let her soul continue to live in a ruined house. But so that he may avenge her, she will wait for Collatine to know what has happened. She looks forward to reclaiming her honor with her death.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1212-1295:</lineref> Lucrece calls for her maid. She does not dare ask its cause, but Lucrece&#8217;s grief is so obvious that she begins to cry in sympathy. The two women stand weeping for some time, until Lucrece finally asks the maid to stop. Hardly able to say the name, she asks when Tarquin left; he was gone by the time the maid woke up. Greatly daring, the maid asks Lucrece why she is so sad, but Lucrece refuses to answer. Preparing to write a letter, she tells the maid to have a messenger ready to carry a letter to Collatine.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1296-1330:</lineref> Alone, Lucrece begins to plan her letter, wavering between literary style and plainness. In the end she merely asks Collatine to visit her as swiftly as possible, not daring to tell him what has happened until she kills herself, for fear that he will not believe in her guiltlessness. In person, displaying her distress, he will not suspect her.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1331-1491:</lineref> The messenger blushes guilelessly as she gives him the letter. Lucrece imagines he knows what has happened and is embarrassed to look at her. He leaves, and, worn out by grieving, she waits for his return. Time passes extremely slowly; to fill it, she looks at a painting showing the Sack of Troy. It is filled with suffering people, but Lucrece cannot find one who equals her grief, until she sees Hecuba, the queen of Troy, staring at her dead husband. The old woman&#8217;s woe matches Lucrece&#8217;s, but cannot speak. Lucrece offers to speak for her, to rail at her enemies, particularly at Helen and Paris, whose lust caused this war. Why should a single person&#8217;s private pleasure be allowed to produce such horrors?</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1492-1568:</lineref> Troy&#8217;s disaster sets her weeping again, and she looks for more grieving people to lament over. Then she finds Sinon, the traitor: a beautiful, trustworthy-looking fellow. She wants to insist that a traitor could never look so innocent, but then she remembers Tarquin, and she rips Sinon&#8217;s portrait up&#8212;before mocking herself for doing something he cannot feel.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1569-1610:</lineref> At last Collatine arrives, with other lords. Lucrece&#8217;s husband is shocked to find her wearing mourning garments and grief-stricken. They stare at each other, until at last Collatine asks what has happened. Lucrece tries to answer, but cannot speak words: three times she tries, but only sighs.</line>
	
<line><lineref>Lines 1611-1687:</lineref> Speaking plainly, she tells Collatine and his friends what occurred. She speaks of her ravisher&#8217;s strength and insists that her mind remains pure and never consented. Collatine is wordless, and Lucrece asks him to let her be the only one openly weeping. Then she calls on him to revenge her and himself.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1688-1729:</lineref> Before naming her rapist, Lucrece asks the others to swear they will avenge her. They do so, anxious to know who they must fight. Then Lucrece asks how she can be washed clean of what has happened to her, and where her guilt lies. They all insist that since she did not consent, she is innocent of any wrong, but she rejects that, afraid women will claim rape as an excuse for adultery. With great difficulty, she names Tarquin as her rapist, and stabs herself.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1730-1806:</lineref> The lords stand paralysed. At last Lucrece&#8217;s father falls on her body, while Brutus pulls out the dagger she used. Lucretius laments over his daughter&#8217;s body, cursing at the unfairness of a child dying before the parent. Collatine finally shakes off his paralysis and falls by his wife&#8217;s side, wanting to die himself until his thoughts turn to revenge. He tries to talk, but can only mumble, nobody understanding a word&#8212;except, occasionally, &#8220;Tarquin&#8221;. Lucretius and Collatine begin to lament in tandem, each outdoing the other&#8217;s show of grief.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1807-1855:</lineref> Brutus has for many years been pretending to be a fool to keep himself safe from the Tarquins. He now ceases to pretend and begins to egg Collatine on towards revenge. He leads the lords in an oath that they will avenge Lucrece&#8217;s death; and when all have sworn, they decide to parade Lucrece&#8217;s body through Rome and tell what Tarquin did. They do so, and the Romans banish Tarquin forever.</line>

<subtitle>The Argument</subtitle>
<line globalnumber="4" type="argument">Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be cruelly murd&#8217;red, and contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or staying for the people&#8217;s suffrages, had possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea; during which siege, the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the King&#8217;s son, in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humor they all posted to Rome, and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife (though it were late in the night) spinning amongest her maids; the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports; whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece&#8217; beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber, violently ravish&#8217;d her, and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed; with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the King, wherewith the people were so moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to consuls.</line>
