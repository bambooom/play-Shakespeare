<line globalnumber="191" number="53" form="verse">Is at this day in Germany call&#8217;d Meisen.</line>
<line globalnumber="192" number="54" form="verse">Then doth it well appear the Salique law</line>
<line globalnumber="193" number="55" form="verse">Was not devised for the realm of France;</line>
<line globalnumber="194" number="56" form="verse">Nor did the French possess the Salique land</line>
<line globalnumber="195" number="57" form="verse">Until four hundred one and twenty years</line>

<line globalnumber="209" number="71" form="verse">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</line>
<line globalnumber="210" number="72" form="verse">To fine his title with some shows of truth,</line>
<line globalnumber="211" number="73" form="verse">Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</line>
<line globalnumber="212" number="74" form="verse">Convey&#8217;d himself as th&#8217; heir to th&#8217; Lady Lingare,</line>
<line globalnumber="213" number="75" form="verse">Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</line>
<line globalnumber="214" number="76" form="verse">To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</line>

<line globalnumber="222" number="84" form="verse">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</line>
<line globalnumber="223" number="85" form="verse">Was re-united to the crown of France.</line>
<line globalnumber="224" number="86" form="verse">So that, as clear as is the summer&#8217;s sun,</line>

I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-liver&#8217;d and red-fac&#8217;d; by the means whereof &#8217;a faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof &#8217;a breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest &#8217;a should be thought a coward; but his few bad words are match&#8217;d with as few good deeds; for &#8217;a never broke any man&#8217;s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Callice they stole a fire-shovel. I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men&#8217;s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another&#8217;s pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them, and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.</line>

Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th&#8217; effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction.

<line globalnumber="1517" number="80" form="prose">No; nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are; yet in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.</line>

<line globalnumber="1523" number="86" form="prose">Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know we are the King&#8217;s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Williams">WILL.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="1524" number="87" form="prose">But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs, and arms, and heads, chopp&#8217;d off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, &#8220;We died at such a place&#8221;&#8212;some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry the Fifth">K. HEN.</speaker>
<line globalnumber="1525" number="88" form="prose">So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be impos&#8217;d upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under his master&#8217;s command transporting a sum of money, be assail&#8217;d by robbers and die in many irreconcil&#8217;d iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant&#8217;s damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contriv&#8217;d murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gor&#8217;d the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are punish&#8217;d for before-breach of the King&#8217;s laws in now the King&#8217;s quarrel. Where they fear&#8217;d the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject&#8217;s duty is the King&#8217;s, but every subject&#8217;s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gain&#8217;d; and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.</line>

<line globalnumber="2322" number="115" form="prose">Marry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why, you undid me: for the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vauting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher, and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urg&#8217;d, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me! If not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou liv&#8217;st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoin&#8217;d constancy, for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies&#8217; favors, they do always reason themselves out again. What? A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad; a good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curl&#8217;d pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me! And take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say&#8217;st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</line>
