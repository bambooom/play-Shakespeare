<title short="A Lover&#8217;s Complaint">A Lover&#8217;s Complaint</title>
<playwright>William Shakespeare</playwright>
<pubdate>1591</pubdate>

<poemdescription>
<line>Printed as an appendix to Shakespeare&#8217;s Sonnets, and possibly by him (though doubts have been emitted as to his authorship), <titleref>A Lover&#8217;s Complaint</titleref> overturns much of the misogyny inherent in those poems by giving a voice to a betrayed woman. The seducer is presented as incontrovertibly in the wrong, and the woman as wronged&#8212;even though she acknowledges that she would likely fall for him again if he returned.</line>
<line><lineref>Lines 1-70:</lineref> The narrator sees a woman sitting by the river, raging and crying. Carelessly dressed, she is tearing up letters and throwing them, along with love tokens, into the river. An old and well-respected man sits next to her and asks her to tell him what&#8217;s going on, in case there&#8217;s anything he can do to help.</line>
<line><lineref>Lines 71-84:</lineref> She explains that it is not age but grief that leaves her looking unattractive; she is in fact beautiful, but she listened to a young man who wished to seduce her, one so good-looking that young women everywhere stared at him.</line>
<line><lineref>Lines 85-148:</lineref> He was heavenly-looking, young (his beard was hardly growing), an excellent speaker, not weak, a brilliant horse rider, an intelligent debater, so that everyone&#8212;old, young, male, female&#8212;was enchanted by him. People even collected pictures of him, and dreamed that he loved them&#8212;and she, the speaker, gave herself to him.</line>
<line><lineref>Lines 149-176:</lineref> But unlike many others, she didn&#8217;t run after him, and she did not yield to him the moment he asked. She had had bad experiences in the past, and kept herself properly guarded. But knowing turned out not to be enough; even though she recognised that he was false, desire overtook her.</line>
<line><lineref>Lines 177-282:</lineref> Still, at first she resisted. But he soon began to court her most seriously, asking her to take pity on him. He argued that everything he&#8217;d done before then was out of lust rather than love. Since the others were willing participants, he claimed, he has not shamed them much. He talked of all the women who have wanted him, and displays the gifts they sent him. He then gave them all to her, as a sign that he truly loved her. Admitting that he had left a trail of broken hearts in his wake, he declared that this made her the most powerful of women. Why, even a nun had desired him. And all the love that was given to him, he would now give to her.</line>
<line><lineref>Lines 283-331:</lineref> He then began to cry, and this melted the speaker&#8217;s heart. And though she now recognizes that it was all fake, she gave in. His cunning allows him to disguise himself in exactly the right way to seduce a given person. And, of course, having had her, he left. Yet though she is now so full of grief, and perfectly aware of what a monster he is, she admits that she would still fall for him again.</line>
