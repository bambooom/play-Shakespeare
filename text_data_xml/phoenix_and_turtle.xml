<title short="The Phoenix &#38; Turtle">The Phoenix &#38; Turtle</title>
<playwright>William Shakespeare</playwright>
<pubdate>1601</pubdate>

<poemdescription>
<line>This enigmatic poem was published in a book of poems dedicated to Sir John Salusbury in 1601, and has long been considered one of Shakespeare&#8217;s most hermetic works. The significance of several of its features are unclear, and are likely to be allegorical images whose very personal meaning is utterly irretrievable. Moreover, it seems that Shakespeare was writing to a theme he had been set rather than of his own volition.</line>

<line>In a style both lyrical and incantatory, the poem tells of the chaste marriage between a phoenix and a turtle (a turtledove, that is, not a reptile), who though two separate beings were a single soul&#8212;so perfect a love, violating all rules of physics and reason, that it was literally incredible, in the true sense of the word. The poet mourns that the two birds have fled &#8216;in a mutual flame&#8217;, and tells of their death and burial together. Yet given that the phoenix&#8217;s defining characteristic is its ability to be reborn from its own flames, one can question whether we are really meant to believe that &#8220;Beauty, Truth and Rarity&#8221; are dead.</line>
