<title>Introduction</title>
<line>Most likely written at a time when the theatres in London were closed by the plague, <titleref>Venus and Adonis</titleref> was one of only two works that we can be certain Shakespeare intended to publish. It was a runaway bestseller, noted for its sexiness and humor; few original copies have made it to the present day simply because they were quite literally read to pieces. The myth of Venus and Adonis, which Shakespeare found in Ovid&#8217;s <titleref>Metamorphoses</titleref>, was well-known, but the poet turns it on its head by making Adonis comically uninterested in the advances of the <nameref>Goddess of Love</nameref>. Despite the fact that Venus&#8217;s efforts are noticeably ineffective, <titleref>Venus and Adonis</titleref> seems to have been taken as something of a pick-up manual by young men at the time.</line>

<line>The plot is quite simple: Venus attempts in every way she can think to convince Adonis to sleep with her. He, however, is not yet sexually mature, and just wants to go hunting. Hearing that he means to go after a boar, she is terrified that he will be killed; and this is, in fact, what happens. She finds his body and is grief-stricken, and he turns into a flower which she decides she will carry with her forever. However funny it is (and there are many moments impossible to take seriously), the poem is strongly structured, with recurring imagery and a detailed rhyme scheme.</line>

<title>Synopsis</title>
<line><lineref>Lines 1-60:</lineref> Early in the morning, Adonis goes hunting, his favourite pastime. Venus, besotted, begins to woo him. Praising his beauty, she pulls him off his mount and demands that he make love with her. He is as deeply embarrassed as she is turned on, but every time he tries to protest, she kisses him on the mouth to keep him from being able to talk.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 61-90:</lineref> Unable to escape her, Adonis lies back and thinks of England. His anxiety makes him only more attractive to Venus. She swears not to let him go unless he kisses her; he appears to be prepared to give her a peck, but just before his lips touch hers he turns away with a wink.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 91-120:</lineref> Venus, horrified, asks him why he won&#8217;t give in, when even Mars, the god of war, was completely subdued by her. She&#8217;s only asking him for a kiss, she says, forcing him to look her in the eye when he insists on staring at the ground.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 121-174:</lineref> Venus asks him if he is ashamed of kissing. Noting that he is very young, she argues that he should take advantage of the time he has. She begins to detail her own beauty, her conversational abilities, her dancing skills; when this has no effect she accuses him of being a narcissist. She insists that Adonis is duty-bound by nature to have sex and reproduce.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 175-258:</lineref> It is by now a burning midday, and Adonis insists he must leave to avoid getting sunburnt. Venus promises to save him from this fate, and bewails Adonis&#8217;s hard-heartedness. She asks again for a kiss, and on being rejected insists that Adonis is no true man. She bursts into tears, but still won&#8217;t let Adonis escape. Trying again, she begins to metaphorically detail her physical assets and the pleasures Adonis might take therein. But the boy merely smirks disdainfully, escapes her and jumps onto his horse.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 259-318:</lineref> Just at that moment, a mare in heat comes by and Adonis&#8217;s horse breaks his restraints and gallops after her, in spite of all Adonis&#8217;s attempts to control him. The horse is outdistanced by the flirtatious mare, who eventually stops teasing the stallion, calming him down.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 319-330:</lineref> Adonis, not been best pleased by these shenanigans, dismounts in order to tie up his horse, but the mare suddenly gallops off and the stallion follows, leaving Adonis on his own. The boy, whose temper is not improved by the chafing resulting from the unexpected ride, sits down while cursing the animal.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 331-366:</lineref> Venus catches up with him. Adonis pulls his hat down on his face to pretend that he doesn&#8217;t see her, but this has no effect: Venus steals up to him, lifts up his hat and begins to woo him again, paying no attention to his glaring.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 367-436:</lineref> Adonis finally loses his temper, pointing out that he&#8217;s had a very bad day, it&#8217;s all her fault, and he just wants to get his horse back. She suggests that the horse&#8217;s lustfulness is a good example for him. The sexually immature boy points out that he only loves to hunt.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 427-480:</lineref> Venus simply does not understand, and lists off the ways she loves him. Realising she may have gone too far as his glare grows, she pretends to faint; Adonis, worried she may be dead, tries to slap her awake. When that doesn&#8217;t work, he feels he has to revive her with a kiss&#8212;or, as we would say, attempt artificial respiration.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 481-570:</lineref> Overjoyed, she pretends to revive, and demands he kiss her again. He promises to if she&#8217;ll say good-night and put an end to all this. Immediately she agrees, and kisses him. It is a passionate kiss, and she soon pushes him to the ground and has her way with him, he being too weary to resist any further.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 571-612:</lineref> Venus decides to let the frowning boy go, begging that they may meet again tomorrow. He refuses, intent on going boar-hunting with his friends. Horrified at the thought, she pulls him down on top of her, but the youth is incapable of performing. Though she tries to rouse him, she has no effect, and he grows more and more annoyed with her.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 613-726:</lineref> She explains her fear of the boar and warns him against the creature&#8217;s dangers, terrified that it will harm him. She tells him she is certain he will die if he goes hunting tomorrow. However much Adonis struggles, Venus insists she will not let him up until her warnings sink into his brain. Adonis tells her to release him: it is now fully dark, his friends are expecting him, and he is worried about tripping in the dark.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 727-768:</lineref> The reason it&#8217;s dark, Venus claims, is that the moon (Cynthia) is hiding in shame that Adonis is so beautiful. Death is a punishment for the existence of Adonis&#8217;s beauty, Venus argues, and therefore he should breed, so that his looks can be reproduced in his children. Otherwise people will remember him as equivalent to a suicide.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 769-817:</lineref> Recognising that she is on the verge of begging for sex again, Adonis interrupts her. The more she lectures him, the less he likes her; he cannot be persuaded, and would much rather sleep than sleep with someone. What she&#8217;s talking about is lust, not love, he says, before admitting that he&#8217;s too young to lecture on the subject. He informs her that he&#8217;s leaving and will no longer listen to her, breaks away from her and runs home.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 818-858:</lineref> Venus, left lying on the ground, stares after him, but he is soon lost in the darkness. She bursts into self-pitying tears and improvises a song with the echoes of her cries of &#8216;Woe&#8217; until dawn comes.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 859-906:</lineref> After sunup, Venus goes looking for Adonis. Hearing the sounds of hunting hounds and horns, she runs towards them. The hounds&#8217; noise is fixed in a single place, meaning that the quarry is caught but not yet dead, which is the most dangerous part of a hunt. She tells herself that there&#8217;s nothing to fear, but at that moment she spots the boar, whose snout is covered in blood. Her fear returns.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 907-936:</lineref> Wildly running about, she finally she comes across a hound, then one licking its wounds, then another. More hounds appear, and they howl as in grief.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 937-1032:</lineref> Venus begins to rail at Death until her tears overcome her. Then she hears a huntsman call out, and starts to hope again, deciding that it was Adonis&#8217;s voice. Revived, she starts to apologise to Death, insisting that she was joking. She accuses herself of being silly, and goes running towards a merry hunting horn she hears&#8212;and comes across Adonis&#8217;s body, gored by the boar.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1033-1068:</lineref> She closes her eyes so as to avoid seeing, but when they open again Adonis is still there, surrounded by his spilled blood. Incapable of speech, Venus stares at his wounds until she begins to see double.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1069-1122:</lineref> She begins to vocalise her mourning, speaking praise of Adonis and of how nature adored him. Eventually she insists that the boar cannot have meant to kill him, only to kiss him. If she had the boar&#8217;s tusks, her kisses would have killed him too. She falls down and covers her face with his blood.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1123-1164:</lineref> She tests that he is indeed dead, and pulls open his eyes to look at them: they can still reflect her. Venus decrees that henceforward love shall always be accompanied by sorrow and jealousy. She lists all of the evils that will now be caused by love. In revenge for her losing Adonis, lovers shall no longer enjoy those they love.</line>

<line><lineref>Lines 1165-1194:</lineref> Adonis is metamorphosed into a purple flower. Venus smells its perfume and decides to wear it forever between her breasts. Picking it, she leaves for her home, intending to lock herself up there and never be seen again.</line>
