My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir&#8217;d; but I (his brother) gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</line>

Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in; therefore out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search, and altogether against my will.</line>

I&#8217;ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man&#8217;s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother; therefore use thy discretion&#8212; I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to&#8217;t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta&#8217;en thy life by some indirect means or other; for I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.</line>

<line globalnumber="634" number="12" form="verse">A fool, a fool! I met a fool i&#8217; th&#8217; forest,</line>
<line globalnumber="635" number="13" form="verse">A motley fool. A miserable world!</line>
<line globalnumber="636" number="14" form="verse">As I do live by food, I met a fool,</line>
<line globalnumber="637" number="15" form="verse">Who laid him down, and bask&#8217;d him in the sun,</line>
<line globalnumber="638" number="16" form="verse">And rail&#8217;d on Lady Fortune in good terms,</line>
<line globalnumber="639" number="17" form="verse">In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.</line>
<line globalnumber="640" number="18" form="verse">&#8220;Good morrow, fool,&#8221; quoth I. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; quoth he,</line>
<line globalnumber="641" number="19" form="verse">&#8220;Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.&#8221;</line>
<line globalnumber="642" number="20" form="verse">And then he drew a dial from his poke,</line>
<line globalnumber="643" number="21" form="verse">And looking on it, with lack-lustre eye,</line>
<line globalnumber="644" number="22" form="verse">Says very wisely, &#8220;It is ten a&#8217; clock.</line>
<line globalnumber="645" number="23" form="verse">Thus we may see,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;how the world wags.</line>
<line globalnumber="646" number="24" form="verse">&#8217;Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</line>
<line globalnumber="647" number="25" form="verse">And after one hour more &#8217;twill be eleven,</line>
<line globalnumber="648" number="26" form="verse">And so from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</line>
<line globalnumber="649" number="27" form="verse">And then from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</line>
<line globalnumber="650" number="28" form="verse">And thereby hangs a tale.&#8221; When I did hear</line>
<line globalnumber="651" number="29" form="verse">The motley fool thus moral on the time,</line>
<line globalnumber="652" number="30" form="verse">My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</line>
<line globalnumber="653" number="31" form="verse">That fools should be so deep contemplative;</line>
<line globalnumber="654" number="32" form="verse">And I did laugh sans intermission</line>

<line globalnumber="770" number="144" form="verse">Mewling and puking in the nurse&#8217;s arms.</line>

<line globalnumber="775" number="149" form="verse">Made to his mistress&#8217; eyebrow. Then a soldier,</line>
<line globalnumber="776" number="150" form="verse">Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,</line>
<line globalnumber="777" number="151" form="verse">Jealous in honor, sudden, and quick in quarrel,</line>
<line globalnumber="778" number="152" form="verse">Seeking the bubble reputation</line>

In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vild life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (look you) it fits my humor well; 
but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</line>

and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learn&#8217;d no wit by nature, nor art, may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.</line>

At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this 
color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur&#8217;d him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&#8217;s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&#8217;t.</line>

Well, that is the dowry of his wife, &#8217;tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore bless&#8217;d? No, as a wall&#8217;d town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.</line>

The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dash&#8217;d out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have liv&#8217;d many a fair year though Hero had turn&#8217;d nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; 
for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drown&#8217;d; 
and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was&#8212;Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</line>

I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, &#8220;If you said so, then I said so&#8221;; 
and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</line>

If it be true that good wine needs no bush, &#8217;tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnish&#8217;d like a beggar, therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I&#8217;ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women (as I perceive by your simp&#8217;ring, none of you hates them), that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas&#8217;d me, complexions that lik&#8217;d me, and breaths that I defied not; and I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</line>
