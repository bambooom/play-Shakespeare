<poemdescription>
<line>Discovered in 1972 and accepted as Shakespeare&#8217;s work by several leading Shakespeare scholars (though the attribution is disputed by others), <titleref>To the Queen</titleref> is most likely an epilogue specially written for the performance of a play at court, rather like that provided for <titleref>Henry IV, Part Two</titleref>. Addressing Queen Elizabeth directly, Shakespeare eschews the flowery metaphors used by the courtiers who had to flatter her to her face in favour of a simplicity much more suited to a mere subject as he prays for the Queen&#8217;s continued life and health. It is essentially an eighteen-line drawing-out of the sentiment &#8220;Long Live the Queen&#8221;.</line>

<stanza num="1">
<line globalnumber="1" number="1">As the dial hand tells o&#8217;er</line>
<line globalnumber="2" number="2">The same hours it had before,</line>
<line globalnumber="3" number="3">Circular account still lending,</line>
<line globalnumber="4" number="4">So, most mighty Queen we pray,</line>
<line globalnumber="5" number="5">Like the dial day by day</line>
<line globalnumber="6" number="6">You may lead the seasons on,</line>
<line globalnumber="7" number="7">Making new when old are gone,</line>
<line globalnumber="8" number="8">That the babe which now is young</line>
<line globalnumber="9" number="9">And hath yet no use of tongue</line>
<line globalnumber="10" number="10">Many a Shrovetide here may bow</line>
<line globalnumber="11" number="11">To that empress I do now,</line>
<line globalnumber="12" number="12">That these children of these lords,</line>
<line globalnumber="13" number="13">Sitting at your council boards,</line>
<line globalnumber="14" number="14">May be grave and ag√®d seen</line>
<line globalnumber="15" number="15">Of her that was their fathers&#8217; queen.</line>
<line globalnumber="16" number="16">Once I wish this wish again,</line>
<line globalnumber="17" number="17">Heaven subscribe it with &#8220;Amen&#8221;.</line>
